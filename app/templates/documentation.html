                All files needed to successfully run DICOMsort 
                are contained within this executable. Please see below for specific
                installation instructions.</p>
                <p>All install files can be found in the 
                <a href="{{ url_for('downloads') }}">Downloads</a> section.</p>

                <p>After successful installation, you should see the following:</p>

            <h2 id="windows-installation">Windows Installation</h2>
            <p>After downloading the Windows install file, double click the setup 
            file to run the installer. You will be prompted to select a few 
            options such as where to install the files as well as whether to 
            include a desktop icon.</p>

            <p>The Windows executable is currently only 32-bit due to limitations
            of <a target="_blank" href="http://cx-freeze.sourceforge.net">cx_freeze</a>. We hope to have a 64-bit version available in the near 
            future.</p>

            <p>After successful installation, you should be able to launch the
            program from either your Program Files folder or the Start Menu.</p>

            <div class="well">
                <p><b>NOTE:</b> DICOMsort uses an .ini configuration file which is
                located in the Program Files directory alongside the executable. As
                a result, the program must be able to write to the DICOM Sort folder
                that contains the executable. On Windows 7, this may require that you
                run the application as an administrator.</p>

            <h2 id="mac-installation">Mac Installation</h2>
            <p>The Mac executable is found within the Mac OS X Disk Image file (DMG) that

            </div>

            <p>Simply drag and drop the <b>DICOM Sort.app</b> file from the DMG
            onto your local machine, preferably in your <b>Applications</b> 
            folder. Double-clicking the file should launch the program.

            <h2 id="source-installation">Source Installation</h2>
            <p>It may be desirable to run the software from the source code if there
            is a bug fix that may not yet be available in the executable form or
            possibly if you're running Linux.</p>

            <p>To successfully install from source, you will need to obtain the
            specific versions of the python modules specified below. This software
            has not been tested on Python versions beyond 2.7.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>pydicom</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/darcymason/pydicom">0.9.9</a></li>
                <li><b>wxpython</b> <a target="_blank" href="https://wxpython.org">3.0</a></li>
            </ul>

            <p>The stable release of the source code can be found 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/dicomsort/dicomsort/tree/v2.1.8">here</a>. 
            The source code can either be downloaded directly from github or cloned using the following command:</p>

            <div style="margin-top:15px;">
            <pre>$ git clone https://github.com/dicomsort/dicomsort.git</pre>
            </div>

            Once you have downloaded the source code and installed the appropriate modules,
            you should be able to launch the software by running the DicomSort.pyw file.
            <div style="margin-top:15px;">
            <pre>$ python DicomSort.pyw</pre>
            </div>


            <div class="page-header">
                <h1 id="sorting">Sorting</h1>
                The primary purpose of DICOMsort is to sort DICOM images into
                subfolders based upon the information provided in the DICOM
                header. This program allows you to specify <em>exactly</em> 
                which fields to sort by, thereby providing a great deal of 
                flexibility.
            </div>

            <h2 id="source-directory">The Source Directory</h2>
            <p>The first step in the sorting process is to specify where the DICOM
            images that you would like to sort are located. Typically this would
            be a CD exported from either an imaging system or PACS system.</p>

            <p>Sorting is performed in a recursive fashion in that all images in
            the source directory are sorted, even those in subfolders. As a 
            result be careful and specify a directory that contains only the
            images that you would like to sort.</p>

            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/source.dir.png') }}">

            <p>The source directory can be specified using the <b>Browse</b> 
            button or simply by entering the directory or dragging the directory
            into the text field.</p>

            <p>Once the directory has been selected, the program will scan the 
            folder in an attempt to find DICOM images. A warning will be provided
            if no valid DICOM images were located. If all goes well, the 
            <b>DICOM Properties</b> list should be populated with fields from the 
            DICOM header</p>

            <h2 id="dicom-properties">DICOM Properties</h2>
            <p>The <b>DICOM Properties</b> provides a list of valid fields that
            were available for the DICOM images within your source directory. 
            These are the fields that can be used for sorting. It 
            is important to note that this list will change from modality to 
            modality and image to image.</p>

            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/dicom.props.png') }}">
            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/prop.search.png') }}">

            <p>In order to quickly find a particular DICOM header field, use
            the search box located below the <b>DICOM Properties</b> list.</p>

            <h2 id="sort-properties">Properties To Use</h2>
            <p>The <b>Properties To Use</b> list shows the fields that are going
            to be used for the sorting. By default, the SeriesDescription is
            used.</p>

            <p>The top of the list represents the top-level folder while lower
            items are successive subfolders</p>


            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/sortorder.png') }}" style="border:0px;">

            <h4>Adding Sortable Fields</h4>
            <p>Fields can be selected for sorting by either double-clicking on the
            property in the <b>DICOM Properties</b> list, or clicking on the <b>&gt;&gt;</b> button.</p>

            <p>New fields are either added at the top of the list of underneath the
            currently-selected item.</p>
           
            <h4>Removing Sortable Fields</h4>
            <p>Fields can be removed from analysis by either double-clicking on the
            property in the <b>Properties to Use</b> list, or clicking on the <b>&lt;&lt;</b> button.</p>

            <p>Due to the fact that SeriesDescription often distinguishes similar
            images, if you choose to remove the SeriesDescription field, you will
            be prompted if you want to change the file naming convention to 
            ensure unique sorting.</p>

            <h4>Reordering Sortable Fields</h4>
            <p>You can re-arrange the ordering of the <b>Properties to Use</b>
            list by either dragging the fields around or using the <b>Up</b>
            and <b>Down</b> buttons.

            <h2 id="fname-format">Filename Format</h2>
            <p>By default we use a filename format which is a combination of the
            image type and instance number. This results in Images such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Image (0001)</li>
                <li>Mag (0001)</li>
                <li>Phase (0001)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This behavior can be changed in the preferences panel accessible
            via the File menu.</p> 

            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/fname.format.png') }}">

            <p>The options are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Image (0001)</b> - This is the default behavior as described above</li>
                <li><b>Keep Original Filename</b> - Like it states, this will use the original 
                names rather than renaming the individual files. The files, however will still be
                sorted into subfolders.</li>
                <li><b>Custom Filename Format</b> - You can specify the filename specification you would like to use. You
                are able to use token-based python string notation using any valid DICOM field (more info 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting">here</a>.
                The string that currently populates this field is the string that is
                used to generate the Image (0001) format.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="sorting-button">Sorting The Images</h2>
            <p>When you are satisfied with your selection, click the <b>Sort Images</b>
            button to perform the sorting. You will be presented with a dialog to
            select the destination directory. This can be an existing directory
            or a new directory. If you hit cancel, the sorting procedure will not
            be performed.</p>

            <p>The status of the sorting procedure is displayed in the status
            bar. If there is an error during sorting, a log file will be created
            in the program folder. Be sure to submit a bug report so we can get
            it fixed!</p>

            <div class="page-header">
                <h1 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h1>
                In addition to sorting of DICOM images, DICOMsort is capable of 
                performing simple and customizable anonymization of patient data.
            </div>

            <h2 id="standard-anon">Standard Anonymization</h2>
            <p>Anonymization can be performed during image sorting or on DICOM 
            images in-place. The user can enable Anonymization by simply selecting
            the <b>Anonymize Data</b> checkbox above the <b>Sort Images</b> button.
            When you check this box, you will be presented with a popup which
            allows you to specify the replacement Patient Name and optionally the PatientID.</p>

            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/anonymize.png') }}">

            <h2 id="custom-anon">Custom Anonymization</h2>
            <p>Because manufacturers all interpret the DICOM standard differently, 
            it may be necessary to specify additional fields to anonymize. You can
            specify the fields to anonymize as well as the replacement values in the
            Preference panel (Accessible from the File Dialog).</p>

            <img class="image" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/documentation/anonfields.png') }}">

            <h4>Specifying Field to Anonymize</h4>
            <p>To specify that you want to remove a field from the DICOM images,
            be sure that the checkbox next to the field is selected. The field
            will be replaced by the value specified to the right, or nothing if
            it is left blank.</p>

            <h4>Specifying a Replacement Value</h4>
            <p>You can specify the value to use in place of the actual data in 
            the right-hand column. </p>
            <p>One of the real powerful features is that you
            can use python-based token-based string replacements. For example, 
            in the screenshot above, the PatientID field will be filled in with
            the value of the PatientName field. The token can be any other valid
            DICOM field present in the image. More information about the token-based 
            strings can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting">here</a>.</p>

            <p>Be sure to save your own default configuration to make your life easier.</p>
